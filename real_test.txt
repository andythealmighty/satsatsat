The following text Is from Amy Tan's 1989 novel The Joy Luck Chib. The narrator describes practicing the piano when she was a child.
For the talent show, I was to play a piece called "Pleading Child" from Schumann's Scenes from Childhood, it was a simple, moody piece that sounded more difficult than it was. I was supposed to memorize the whole thing, playing the repeat parts twice to make the place sound longer. But I dawdled over it, playing a few bars and then cheating, looking up to see what notes followed. I never really listened to what I was playing. I daydreamed about being somewhere else, about being someone else.

The soil on Mars can make missions to explore the planet challenging, as the sand and dust are known to clog filters and lock moving parts on robotic rovers and other exploration devices. Using simulants, which are materials designed to simulate different planetary surfaces, scientists are able to study the characteristics of Mars's surface. Simulants like the Mars Mojave simulant—which was developed using lava deposits from California's Mojave Desert-help scientists evaluate how well their devices will handle the surface when operated on Mars.
Based on the text, what Is one reason why simulants are valuable for scientists?
Scientists use simulants to track how the chemical properties of planetary soils have changed over time.
Scientists use stimulants to compare the physical properties of Mars's surface to those of Earth's surface.
Simulants can be mixed with soil from Earth to explore how research equipment will handle extreme terrains on Earth.
Simulants allow scientists to test the ability of research equipment to withstand some of the conditions it will encounter during a mission.

Which quotation from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz most effectively illustrates the claim?
"Once more (Dorothy and her companions) could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green.”
"Then [Dorothy] went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds."
"Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else."
"When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country."

To measure whether countries in free trade agreements (FTAs)-agreements among nations to reduce tariffs, duties, and other trade barriers— experience changes in total agricultural exports, economist Kayode Ajewole and colleagues calculated average export growth rates for several countries over the five years before and the five years after entering an FTA with the United States. The graph shows the results for three countries in the study. Consulting the graph, a student claims that joining an FTA increases the rate of growth of a country's total agricultural exports.
Which choice best describes data from the graph that weaken the student's claim?
All the countries shown had positive growth in agricultural exports over the five years after joining their respective FTAs, but their rates of export growth varied.
Although agricultural experts from Nicaragua grew over the five years after Nicaragua joined CAFTA-DR, their growth rate was even higher in the five years before CAFTA-DR.
Although agricultural exports from Mexico decreased over the five years before NAFTA, a reversal in this trend was observed over the five years after Mexico joined NAFTA.
Over the five years after El Salvador joined CAFTA-DR, agricultural exports from El Salvador grew at a rate of about 21.8 percent, which is higher than the rate over the five years before El Salvador joined the agreement.

Michelle Pereira et al. hypothesized that introducing health improvements into workplaces would increase productivity by reducing absenteeism (sick employees not working) and presenteeism (sick workers working less productively due to illness). Pereira’s team enrolled groups of Australian workers in two programs; one that gave employees exercise training (EET) and one that enrolled employees in health promotion seminars (EHP). They then calculated the productivity loss of those groups at 12 weeks and 12 months after the programs began (based on the 28 days preceding each point). They concluded that exercise training was more effective at restraining productivity loss than health promotion seminars were, though this result took time to become apparent.
Which choice best describes data from the table that most effectively strengthen Pereira and colleagues' conclusion?
Productivity loss for the EET group barely decreased between 12 weeks and 12 months after the program began, while productivity loss for the EHP group significantly increased during the same time period.
Productivity loss was largely due to absenteeism for the EHP group at 12 months after the program began, while productivity loss was largely due to presenteeism for the EET group at 12 months after the program began.
Productivity loss was consistently higher for the EHP group than for the EET group over the twelve months that it was measured, though the size of the difference between the two decreased over that time.
Productivity loss was fairly similar for the EET and EHP groups 12 weeks after each program began, but at 12 months afterward it had significantly increased for the EHP group and significantly decreased for the EFT group.

Ningyo joruri is a form of theater that was popular in eighteenth-century Japan and that unites puppetry with playing of the shamisen, a stringed musical instrument. The popularity of ningyo joruri was due to a puppetry method called sannin zukai, in which three puppeteers operated a single puppet that was large, detailed, and capable of extensive movement and nuanced emotional expression. Over the ensuing centuries. audience interest in ningyo joruri began to decline and sannin zukai became prohibitively expensive to mount. so that sannin zukai puppeteers could no longer make the profession a full-time career. Eventually, ningyo joruri productions resorted to cheaper forms of puppetry, such as kurama ningyo, which involves only one puppeteer.
Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence?
The kuruma ningyo puppeteering method is not easy; it requires fewer puppeteers to manipulate puppets that are as large as those used in sannin zukai, but each puppeteer's work is more complex.
The costs of building sannin zukai puppets were very high until the advent of machine-based production methods in the nineteenth century made them comparable to the costs of building kuruma ningyo puppets.
In 1872, Japanese puppeteer Nishikawa Koryu developed a technique called kuruma ningyo, or cart puppetry, in which puppets have wooden pegs on their feet that the puppeteer can manipulate by moving his own feet.
The few remaining theatrical companies with sannin zukai performers in the present day are mostly amateur troupes, in which members have other forms of employment that serve as their primary source of income.

Hycean planets are a class of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) with oceans of liquid water--critical to supporting life and atmospheres rich in hydrogen. Computer models have determined that for potential hycean planets, the range of the habitable zone (HZ), the distance from a star that allows a planet to retain liquid water on its surface. begins at about 1 astronomical unit (AU). In 2021, Nikku Madhusudhan et al. identified K2- 18 bas a hycean candidate, noting that the planet is located right on the inner edge of the HZ.
Text 2
In a 2023 paper, Shang-Min Tsai et al. claimed that the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of K2-18 b and other hycean candidates admit wavelengths of light that cause elevated surface temperatures and increased water evaporation. Unlike earlier assessments, Tsai et al.'s calculations therefore placed the inner edge for these planets' HZ as far out as 3.85 AU.

Based on the texts, how would Tsai et al. (Text 2) most likely respond to Madhusudhan et al.'s research, as presented in Text 1?
By arguing that K2-18 b and other hycean candidates are unlikely to support life because these planets are located too far from the stars they orbit
By stating that the chemical composition of the atmosphere of the hycean candidate Madhusudhan et al. identified suggests that this planet's surface is unlikely to harbor liquid water
By maintaining that Madhusudhan et al. relied on a model whose estimates of surface temperatures on hycean candidates are likely too high
By observing that unlike the hycean candidate Madhusudhan et al. discovered, most other types of planets with hydrogen rich atmospheres are likely located within the HZ

Mexican architect Luis Barragán's prolife career, which spanned the 1920s to the 1980s, evolved through distinct phases. After traveling to the United States and Europe in the early 1930s and immersing himself in a broader architectural discourse, Barragan began incorporating principles derived from functionalism and modernism in his work, as seen in the houses in Avenida Parque Mexico, whose unadorned geometric forms contrast with his earlier projects in Guadalajara, such as the house in Calle Liceo, which evince the aesthetics of traditional Mediterranean and Mexican styles.
Information in the text best supports which statement about the design of the house in Cale Liceo?
It represents a transitional moment between the early and late phases of Barragán's development.
It displays the effects of Barragán's exposure to international architectural trends in the 1930s
It reflects an approach to ornamentation and shape that Barragán later stopped using 
It is characteristic of the Guadalajaran architecture that influenced Barragán throughout his career.

Some scientists have suggested that as ocean temperatures rise, many fish and corals found in the shallow zone (less than 30 meters below the surface) could take refuge in the cooler, darker mesophotic zone (30 to 150 meters below the surface). However, it isn't clear that all such species will be able to tolerate mesophotic conditions. In 2018, Luiz Rocha and colleagues studied stony corals in the two zones in Caribbean and Indo-Pacific waters. Based on the depths at which those corals are now found, the species that seems least suited to a full migration to the mesophotic zone is ____.
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
Astropora expansa, because its maximum depth of 15 meters is furthest from the mesophotic zone.
Scolymia lacera, because its minimum depth of 10 meters is in the shallow zone.
Acropora echinata, because its maximum depth of 25 meters is close to but doesn't reach the mesophotic zone.
Heliofungia fralinae, because its minimum depth of 3 meters is the shallowest of those listed.

Adelaide, Australia, has installed engineered structures along 53% of its shoreline to protect infrastructure from wave corrosion and other hazards, a practice known as shoreline hardening. To evaluate the responses of waterbirds to two types of hardening structures—riprap and bulkheads—Diann Prosser et al. surveyed waterbird communities consisting of the brown pelican, the red knot, and 62 other species at different sites in the Chesapeake Bay on the US East Coast. Utilizing the Index of Waterbird Community Integrity AWCI), on which a high score corresponds to high community integrity, the researchers found that bulkheads are more strongly negatively correlated with waterbird community integrity than is riprap.
Which finding, if true, would most directly lustrate the researchers' finding?
The difference in average IWCI scores for waterbird communities at Stony and Old Road, two sites with a higher percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads than of riprap, was statistically insignificant.
Waterbird communities at Curtis, a site with equal percentages of shoreline consisting of bulkheads and riprap, had higher average IWCI scores than did waterbird communities at Miles, a site with different percentages of shoreline consisting of bulkheads and riprap.
Waterbird communities at Old Road, a site with a relatively high percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads, had lower average IWCI scores than did waterbird communities at Miles, a site with a relatively high percentage of shoreline consisting of riprap.
Waterbird communities at Curtis, a site with a high percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads and riprap, had lower average IWCI scores than did waterbird communities at Onancock, a site with a low percentage of shoreline consisting of bulkheads and riprap.

Piezoelectric harvesters convert kinetic energy (resonance) to electrical energy, precluding the need for external electrical sources. The vibration of a spacecraft, for example, can provide sufficient energy to power many of its sensors piezoelectrically. A newly designed piezoelectric harvester incorporating a highly conductive carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CERP) electrode has been shown to provide steady energy loads during resonance, an absolute prerequisite for wireless communication devices to be powered piezoelectrically:
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the text's claim about wireless communication devices?
The near constant kinetic vibration of a spacecraft makes it possible to power its wireless communication devices using only non CERP piezoelectric harvesters.
The high conductivity of the CFRP is what makes the energy output from a piezoelectric harvester sufficient for wireless communication devices.
Intermittent or unpredictable electrical supply undermines the efficacy of Wireless communication devices.
The CFRP electrode is incompatible with most wireless communication devices.

Consumers increasingly expect that goods they purchase online will be delivered rapidly, even as soon as the day of purchase. Although efficiencies in long distance transport of parcels have greatly improved delivery times, last mile logistics (the final step in delivery to consumers) present a bottleneck for delivery companies. Time pressure resulting from consumer expectations is not the only challenge; other obstacles, such as complex and RAG inefficient delivery routes, persist. While innovations to mitigate these challenges have been emerging-the use of autonomous delivery robots, for instance-success has ben constrained due to the additional complications that arise (e.g. robots travel relatively slowly since they must navigate many ground-level obstacles). Consequently, ____.
Which choice most logically completes the text?
the use of autonomous delivery robots may enable delivery companies to meet consumers' expectations now but likely is not viable as a permanent solution.
innovations in last-mile logistics seem poised to increase consumers' expectations for rapid delivery.
delivery companies should invest more funds in proven long-distance transport technologies than in untested last-mile solutions.
in the near term, delivery companies are unlikely to overcome the impediments associated with last-mile logistics.

Microbial fuel cels (MECs) capitalize on the ability of some species of bacteria to metabolize metal, liberating electrons. The bacteria form a dense biofilm on the surface of an electron collecting anode, but moving the electrons from the bacterial cytoplasm to an external electrode requires that the electrons pass through a series of inefficient oxidation reduction (redox) reactions. Accordingly, MFC power output rarely exceeds a density of 0.30 milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2). In an experiment, researchers added silver nanoparticles to carbon paper covering the anode in an MFC. The resulting power density was 0.66 mW/cm2. since metals such as silver exhibit high electrical conductivity, the researchers hypothesized that____.
Which choice most logically completes the text?
silver nanoparticles may increase the metabolic processes of the bacteria, thereby increasing the number of free electrons available to transfer to the electrode.
electrons may be conducted directly to the electrode before the silver nanoparticles catalyze the redox reactions.
as the density of the biofilm increases, the series of redox reactions may accelerate independent of the presence of the silver nanoparticles.
silver nanoparticles may allow electrons to bypass the series of redox reactions and transfer directly to the electrode.

Many studies have found a positive association between levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury in bodies of fresh water undisturbed by human activity. But Stéphane Guédron, Delphine Tisserand, and colleagues did not find this correlation in an examination of freshwater bodies impacted by wastewater, leading some scientists to hypothesize that the association could be particular to undisturbed waters. However, Ida Tjerngren and colleagues carried out a study on freshwater bodies disturbed by urban development that showed similar results to the studies on undisturbed waters, suggesting that ____.

Which choice most logically completes the text?
the effects of wastewater on the association between levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury should not be taken as indicative of the effects of every type of human disturbance.
Guédron, Tisserand, and colleagues' study used different methods to measure the concentration of mercury in fresh water than Tjerngren and colleagues' study 2 did.
disturbances linked to wastewater affect significantly more bodies of fresh water than disturbances linked to urban development do.
levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury are both much higher in bodies of fresh water impacted by wastewater than they are in bodies of fresh water disturbed by urban development.

The ratio of methane to other atmospheric constituents-represented by a measure called the methane mole fraction-influences a variety of meteorological phenomena, notably precipitation and humidity. For Titan, Saturn's largest moon, the observational data that exist are too sparse and discrepant to fully constrain the range of the methane mole fraction at various atmospheric levels. Juan Lora and colleagues point out that outputs of the IPSL, atmospheric model of Titan, which track closely to observations in some respects, reflect how the model's developers responded to this challenge: by prescribing a uniform methane mole fraction for the lowest level of the atmosphere. It is therefore important to note that ____.
Which choice most logically completes the text?
even though the model's outputs sometimes agree with observational data, Titan's real methane mole fraction is likely higher than the methane mole fraction used in the model.
inconsistencies across the model's simulations of Titan's precipitation and humidity could be attributable to variations in the moon's methane mole fraction.
further observations of Titan may clarify the moon's methane mole fraction sufficiently for the model to employ a single value rather than a range.
some disagreements between the model's simulations of Titan's precipitation and humidity and the moon's actual precipitation and humidity are to be expected.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:
Modularity of mind is the notion that the mind is at least partly composed of innate neural structures (modules) that perform fast, necessary tasks.
1983: cognitive scientist jerry A. Fodor hypothesized that low-level cognitive systems (e.g., perception, language) are modular:
In Fodorian modularity, high level systems (eg., reasoning) are not modular.
2003; cognitive scientist Peter Carruthers proposed the massive modularity hypothesis (MMH).
MMH expands modularity to include all cognitive systems.

The student wants to compare Fodor's hypothesis with Carrathers's. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
Following Fodor's 1983 hypothesis, Carruthers proposed that modularity of mind includes al cognitive systems.
In 2003, Carruthers proposed the massive modularity hypothesis, disagreeing with Fodor's earlier hypothesis that the mind is composed of innate neural structures.
In considering some but not al cognitive systems modular, Fodorian modularity is not as expansive in its definition of modularity as MMH is.
The hypotheses of Fodor and Carruthers differ in whether they consider low-level cognitive systems, such as perception and language, modular.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:
Digital Light Synthesis (DIS) is a form of additive manufacturing that utilizes light to rapidly cure liquid resin into high-quality, 3D objects.
Step 1: Ultraviolet (UV) light images are projected up into a pool of liquid resin. where the object's first layer takes shape.
Step 2: The partially cured resin object is raised, leaving a thin space (a "dead zone") beneath it for oxygen and liquid resin to flow through.
Step 3: The UV light passes through the dead zone—maintaining the flow of resin— and partially cures additional layers of the object.
Step 4: When the resin object is complete, it is baked in an oven to complete the curing.

The student wants to describe how DLS cures 3D objects. Which choice most effectively uses relevant Information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
DLS cures 3D objects by passing through a "dead zone," adding layers to the object, then curing the object in an oven.
In DLS, UV light is projected into layers of liquid resin until the resin solidifies and passes through a "dead zone," wherein the curing is completed.
In DLS. UV light images are projected into a liquid resin pool to cure a 3D object layer by layer; once solidified, the object is baked in an oven.
DLS is a form of additive manufacturing that creates a "dead zone" in which UV light solidifies layer by layer before being baked in an oven, creating a high-quality, 3D object.
